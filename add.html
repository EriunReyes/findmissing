        <p class="description">Our page is intended to recover the lost people of Ukraine and help them by supplying them with what is necessary for their needs. 
        Ukraine is going through one of the worst moments of this century. Both families and individuals have taken random addresses to save their lives from Russian attacks, 
        looking for where to live and survive. Rescuing Ukrainians and provide donations with the necessary resources until the end of this terrorism that Ukraine is experiencing is our mission.</p>
